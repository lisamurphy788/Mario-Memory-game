# Testing 

## Testing Validator Testing 
 **HTML** - I tested the HTML with [W3C Validation Testing](https://validator.w3.org/) 

 At first i got back 13 warnings but 12 where in relation to naming convention with regards to my blank image. There was accidently a space I removed the space and one got back one warning regarding H2 - H6 headings. This is a styling choice.

 I recieved no errors.

 **Jshint** - I tested the Javascript code using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

 At first i recieved over 23 warnings and one unused variable due to esversion 6 and using arrow functions. I fixed 22 of the warnings by adding  /*jshint esversion: 6 */ to the top of the code this instucts JSHint to ignore these. So then i was left with one warning and one unused variable.
