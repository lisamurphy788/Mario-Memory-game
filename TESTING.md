## Testing Validator Testing 
 **HTML** - I tested the HTML with [W3C Validation Testing] (https://validator.w3.org/) 

 At first i got back 13 warnings but 12 where in relation to naming convention with regards to my blank image. There was accidently a space I removed the space and one got back one warning regarding H2 - H6 headings. This is a styling choice.
