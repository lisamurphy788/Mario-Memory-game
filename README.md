### Project Goals 
The main goal of this project was to build a fun memory game that my little boy could play with so he could get a better undertanding what types of projects i work on. As he is a Mario fanatic i felt it fitting to use his favourite characters. There is no time limit on this as i didnt want him to feel pressured to get it done in a certain amount of time. 

### Design Choices
All Mario games are bright and fun using lots of primary colors. I kept the design light and similar to the color schemes that would be used in a mario game. 

#### Background image 

For the background image i used a animated blue sky with clouds and green grass.

#### Colors

 
All images used were characters from Mario

 ## Features
 
 ### Current Features 

 #### Game Area

 The game area is set up using CSS grid. Setting it up this way helped with responsiveness. There is a total of 12 cards 6 pairs. I kept it simple in order to keep the user engaged.
