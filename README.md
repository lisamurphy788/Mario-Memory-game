#### Site Owner

### Project Goals 
The main goal of this project was to build a fun memory game that my little boy could play with so he could get a better undertanding what types of projects i work on. As he is a Mario fanatic i felt it fitting to use his favourite characters. There is no time limit on this as i didnt want him to feel pressured to get it done in a certain amount of time. 

### Design Choices
All Mario games are bright and fun using lots of primary colors. I kept the design light and similar to the color schemes that would be used in a mario game. 

#### Background image 

For the background image i used a animated blue sky with clouds and green grass. The image is similar to what you would see if you were playing a Mario game.

#### Images

For the cards i used all the main characters of Mario. These can be seen throughout the game. 


#### Colors

The color scheme was to tie in with the theme, bright and fun colors were used so they would provide good contrast throughout the game.

#### Typpgraphy 

I used google font 'Kanit' as it looked fun and the closest i could get. I did use Irish Groover first but found it was extremely difficult to read in the modals. 


#### Wireframes 

Wireframes were designed for laptop, table and phone dislay,

 ## Features
 
 ### Current Features 

 #### Game Area

 The game area is set up using CSS grid. Setting it up this way helped with responsiveness. There is a total of 12 cards 6 pairs. I kept it simple in order to keep the user engaged.

  #### Rules Button 

  I wanted to have this as a button that the user could click on so they would understand the rules of the game and how to begin.

  #### Win Modal 

  This feature shows the user the game is over and how many flips it took. I included and close out so the user has the option to close out and play again.

  Flips Counter 

  The flips counter shows the user how many times they have fliped a card. At the end of the game the win modal shows the total number of flips. The user can then play again if they wish to beat their score.
