### Project Goals 
The main goal of this project was to build a fun memory game that my little boy could play with so he could get a better undertanding what types of projects i work on.

 ## Features
 ### Existing Features
 #### Current Features 

 Game Area

 The game area is set up using CSS grid. Setting it up this way helped with responsiveness. There is a total of 12 cards 6 pairs. I kept it simple in order to keep the user engaged.
